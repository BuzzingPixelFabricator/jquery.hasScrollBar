# Fabricator Width Awareness Component

While this component is designed with the [BuzzingPixel Fabricator Build Process](https://github.com/tjdraper/buzzing-pixel-fabricator) in mind, it can be used anywhere (in theory).

## `$('.my-el').hasScrollBar()`

Checks if the element has a scroll bar (scrolling content).
